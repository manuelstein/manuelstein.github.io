    Taking an MSc after 10 years of work experience while building a house and 
    awaiting my second son was a wonderful experience, not only because it was 
    such a busy time, but because I got taught by 
    [Prof. Kyberd](https://www.brunel.ac.uk/people/paul-kyberd), 
    [Prof. Khan](https://www.brunel.ac.uk/people/akram-khan), 
    [Prof. Li](https://www.brunel.ac.uk/people/maozhenrick-li) and other great personalities.
    And I got to wear a gown and mortarboard, which is an extraordinary experience for a German.

    This cooperative programme and my supervisors at Alcatel SEL AG gave me a 
    great start into applied research and international collaborations.
