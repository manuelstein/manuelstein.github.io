    Create a commonly understood Serverless workflow model language

    The CNCF working group is seeking standardization of how serverless applications are modeled that 
    are loosely coupled event-based, demand-scaled to zero, and interact on a global scale.

    Enable 'real-time' interaction between people and applications over a Service Oriented Infrastructure
  description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
    We've developed the Intelligent Service-Oriented Network Infrastructure for 
    this project to orchestrate machine and network virtualization, which is 
    what you'd call a Cloud infrastructure today. It features a declarative 
    interface (cmp. Kubernetes) and supports performance SLA for real-time 
    workloads.
