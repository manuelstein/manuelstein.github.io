    Create a commonly understood Serverless workflow model language
  description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
    The CNCF working group is seeking standardization of how serverless applications are modeled that 
    are loosely coupled event-based, demand-scaled to zero, and interact on a global scale.

    Enable 'real-time' interaction between people and applications over a 
    Service Oriented Infrastructure
  description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
    We've developed the Intelligent Service-Oriented Network Infrastructure for 
    this project to orchestrate machine and network virtualization, which is 
    what you'd call a Cloud infrastructure today. It features distributed 
    transactions to deploy and maintain application declarations (cmp. 
    Kubernetes declarative resources) and supports performance SLA for 
    real-time workloads.

    Building a distributed IMS with border nodes
  description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
    We unified session border controller and border gateways on common 
    off-the-shelf hardware to run a distributed IMS on a scalable set of 
    IP multimedia exchanges up to deploying OSA applications at the domain 
    edge of the provider network.
